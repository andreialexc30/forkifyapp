<h1>Forkifyapp</h1>
<strong>Short description:</strong> this app was created while following Jonas Schmedtman's Udemy course, titled <i>The Complete JavaScript Course 2020 Build Real Projects</i>. It is the last and biggest project in the course.
<h2>Information</h2>
This app allows you to look up different recipes, save them and even change their servings. Everything is adjustable to your needs, it also supports different measurements system. Sadly because the original forkify API is no longer available, the course teacher has replicated the API to an extend, although it will only be able to search up to 1000 recipes.
<h2>What I've learned</h2>
Jonas Schmedtman's course helped develop my knowledge of JavaScript to a great extent, but the learning never stops. This course initiated me into vanilla JavaScript, it also showed me the modern ES6/2015 and 2020 JavaScript and how easy and shorter it became to write code. It also taught me about AJAX, Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs allowing me to experience the magic of fetching data and using it in my own projects. It introduced me to NodeJS and it's concepts. Everything I have learned during this course has been put to good use in making this last project.
<h2>What's coming next?</h2>
I will be diving next into understanding NodeJS and Rest API better in another course, in the mean time I will try to build my own projects from the ground up using everything I've learned so far.<br />
